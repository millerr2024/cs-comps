List of ideas:

-Denial of service attack 
-SQL injection 
-Socially engineered email (phishing) 
-Cross-site scripting
-Password cracking 
-Network sniffing? Maybe we have our server talk to another server using basic authentication
-MAC Spoofing. Maybe we could combine it with a server that’s set up to block specific IP addresses from ssh’ing in https://www.securew2.com/blog/how-do-mac-spoofing-attacks-work 
-Lateral movement
-URL Interpretation – testing API paths

Scenario: 

A small Midwest liberal arts college’s office website includes an image carousel. The creators of the website created a simple (and not so secure) API interface so the managers of the site could regularly update the pictures of the carousel. 

Step-by-step:

1) Attacker locates site with nmap.

2) Attacker notices that the site uses an API request to get the image files. This API request uses HTTP basic authentication.

3) Attacker gets basic authentication password in plaintext (it’ll probably be in base64).

4) Attacker finds the upload endpoint of the API and uploads a file to the site (using the basic authentication password from step 3). Given that the site checks the file type (making sure it’s a valid image type), the attacker changes the file signature to make it look like the attacker is uploading an image while they are really uploading a php web shell.

5) From the web shell the attacker is running on the site, they find /etc/passwd. This file could either be writeable or the attacker could have to get write permission (depending on whether or not we want to add an extra step). 

6) Attacker modifies /etc/passwd, inserting a new password for root. Attacker now has root permissions on the site.
