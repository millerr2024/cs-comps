	"robots.txt is the filename used for implementing the Robots Exclusion Protocol, a standard 
	used by websites to indicate to visiting web crawlers and other web robots which portions of 
	the website they are allowed to visit.
	
	This relies on voluntary compliance. Not all robots comply with the standard; indeed, email 
	harvesters, spambots, malware and robots that scan for security vulnerabilities may very well
	start with the portions of the website they have been asked (by the Robots Exclusion Protocol)
	to stay out of."
