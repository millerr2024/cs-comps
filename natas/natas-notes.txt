Level 0:
-Steps I took:
	1) Right clicked and selected "Inspect"
	2) Clicked through the HTML until I found the following line under "<body>" and "<div id="content">":

Level 3:
-Steps I took:
	1) Went to http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt and saw the following:
		User-agent: *
		Disallow: /s3cr3t/
	2) Went to http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/
	3) Clicked on users.txt where I found the password
-Password for next level:
	tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm
-Note: I had to lookup the solution to this level. Less dissapointing this time because there was no chance I would have figured this out. 
-Note: Googled what robots.txt is. Wikipedia said:
	"robots.txt is the filename used for implementing the Robots Exclusion Protocol, a standard 
	used by websites to indicate to visiting web crawlers and other web robots which portions of 
	the website they are allowed to visit.
	
	This relies on voluntary compliance. Not all robots comply with the standard; indeed, email 
	harvesters, spambots, malware and robots that scan for security vulnerabilities may very well
	start with the portions of the website they have been asked (by the Robots Exclusion Protocol)
	to stay out of."
